          <p>Cloud storage can be pretty bland and complicated. Simple procedures take too many steps to complete. White backgrounds leave the user longing for more. All in all, cloud storage products tend to be a digital storage unit that no one likes to visit.</p>
          <h3 class="blackText">The Solution</h3>
          <p>Assemble is an exciting platform that allows users to store digital assets and links. Users also have the ability to share items either with all users, or to specific users within a project. Every process put into the product is as simple as possible. This makes Assemble an efficient and beautiful tool that keeps users engaged.</p>

            <p>Tasks included in the MVP became mapped out in a flow chart. A major change happened here. The redundancy of having both labels and tags came to attention. The original intent was to have tags sorted under labels. I realized that this would be a barrier to users and a potential for confusion. Coming back to the idea of simplicity reinforced the importance of this decision. In turn, this instilled in me the importance of going back to your foundations.

            <p class="whiteText">In the first round of design, I decided to have a search bar on the screen. This would ensure that you'd always be able to navigate to what you were looking for with ease. Items and Projects sorted in a grid to keep things organized and skimmable. I thought of using an overflow grid (like Pinterest). The organized chaos of an overflow grid made skimming difficult. This didn't line up with the goal of simplicity. The decision to stick with a basic uniform grid was better aligned with the goal of the product.</p>
            <p class="whiteText">While I considered a few different layouts, most of them proved to be more complicated. This landed in the decision of using a more familiar design. The search bar front and center with the content underneath. Allowing users to know what was on the page as soon as they look at it.</p>

              <p>I appreciated the sharpness that Ubuntu provided in a font that was also more rounded. It's rare that you find a good medium of the two. This accompanied the logo well as it had sharp corners but was round in nature. Muli was a nice pairing because it has a similar structure to Ubuntu. It's nice and legible and had a variety of weights to choose from.</p>

              <p>Quicksand was a great candidate because of its roundness. When I first saw the type I immediately thought friendly and cordial. It also helped that it had an identical structure for the lowercase "a" as I used for the logo. Montserrat was a nice pairing because it's renowned for its weight variety. The structure of it was similar as well.</p>

            <p>This project came with a lot of lessons, both technical and theoretical. The main theme I found myself coming back to was the importance of laying a solid foundation to work on. Making decisions and sticking to them makes for smoother work down the road.  The secondary theme for me in this project was the value of user testing. Many times throughout the process, I would make a decision based on trendy design. Each time I did this, users didn't respond well to the design. It was a solid reminder on the importance of being a user-focused designer. It would be a shame to make beautiful designs that no one liked to use.</p>
