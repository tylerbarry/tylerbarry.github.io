Assemble is an exciting and colorful cloud storage alternative. Users can come together to collaborate on projects or share resources. All while being able to store items.</p>

            <h4 style="color: #211F20; padding-bottom: 0rem">The Problem</h4>
            <p style="color: #211F20">Cloud storage can be pretty bland and complicated. Simple procedures take too many steps to complete. White backgrounds leave the user longing for more. All in all, cloud storage products tend to be a digital storage unit that no one likes to visit. </p>
            <h4 style="color: #211F20; padding-bottom: 0rem">The Solution</h4>
            <p style="color: #211F20">Assemble is an exciting platform that allows users to store digital assets and links. Users also have the ability to share items either with all users, or to specific users within a project. Every process put into the product is as simple as possible. This makes Assemble an efficient and beautiful tool that keeps users engaged.</p>

The original intent was to have tags sorted under labels. I realized that this would be a barrier to users and a potential for confusion. Coming back to the idea of simplicity reinforced the importance of this decision. In turn, this instilled in me the importance of going back to your foundations. Especially while sorting out the details. </p>

            <p>In the first round of design, I decided to have a search bar on the screen. This would ensure that you'd always be able to navigate to what you were looking for with ease. Items and Projects sorted in a grid to keep things organized and skimmable. I thought of using an overflow grid (like Pinterest). The organized chaos of an overflow grid made skimming difficult. This didn't line up with the goal of simplicity. The decision to stick with a basic uniform grid was better aligned with the goal of the product.</p>
            <p>While I considered a few different layouts, most of them proved to be more complicated. This landed in the decision of using a more familiar design. The search bar front and center with the content underneath. Allowing users to know what was on the page as soon as they look at it.</p>

            <p style="color: #211F20">I performed user testing online and in-person with a diverse group of participants. I tested the fundamental operations of the product. These include adding projects, navigating to different pages, and managing files. Participants were able to complete the tasks. On average it took the users roughly 10-15 minutes to figure out what the application was.</p>

            <h5>Visual Design</h5>
            <h4>Branding</h4>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/assemble_logo.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Assemble Logo">
            <p>The product focuses on collaboration. While doing research, I came across the word "assemble". This fit because the product I'm creating was all about assembling projects. On top of that, the product has a social nature, it's a place for people to assemble.  The word was a natural fit for the name as it encompassed every aspect of the application in a single word. It's a place where people can assemble to assemble.</p>
            <p>With the name picked, I assigned three characteristics to communicate through branding:</p>
            <div class="traits">
              <h5 class="trait" style="padding-bottom: 0rem">Energetic</h5>
              <h5 class="trait" style="padding-bottom: 0rem">Friendly</h5>
              <h5 class="trait">Cordial</h5>
            </div>
            <p>Energetic to help communicate efficiency. Friendly to communicate the social nature of the product. Cordial to help find the balance of a social yet professional platform. With these characteristics in place, I put together a mood board to help define the aesthetic.</p>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/moodboard.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Moodboard for Assemble">
            <h4>Branding: Logo</h4>
            <p>With "Assemble" being the name of the product, I created logos that took many pieces to create one logo.</p>
            <div class="image_container">
              <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/logo_drafts.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Logo Drafts for Assemble">
              <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/assemble_vector.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem; max-width: 50%" alt="Logo Vector for Assemble">
            </div>
            <p>After many drafts, I chose this logo because of its simplicity. It's able to convey the message of the brand. It brought pieces together to make a single item, it was simple, it was effective, and it looked like the letter "a".</p>
            <p>Now I needed a typeface to go with this logo. Something with character but easy to read.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="inner brandingType">
            <h4 style="color: #211F20">Branding: Typeface</h4>
            <p style="color: #211F20">When it came to typography, there were two font pairings that I went back and forth on.</p>
            <div class="image_container">
              <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/ubuntu.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Typeface 1: Ubuntu">
            </div>
            <h4 class="blackLine" style="padding-bottom: 0rem">Ubuntu and Muli</h4>
            <p style="color: #211F20">I appreciated the sharpness that Ubuntu provided in a font that was also more rounded. It's rare that you find a good medium of the two. This accompanied the logo well as it had sharp corners but was round in nature. Muli was a nice pairing because it has a similar structure to Ubuntu. It's nice and legible and had a variety of weights to choose from. </p>
            <div class="image_container">
              <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/quicksand.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Typeface 1: Quicksand">
            </div>
            <h4 class="blackLine" style="padding-bottom: 0rem">Quicksand and Montserrat</h4>
            <p style="color: #211F20; padding-bottom: 5rem;" >Quicksand was a great candidate because of its roundness. When I first saw the type I immediately thought friendly and cordial. It also helped that it had an identical structure for the lowercase "a" as I used for the logo. Montserrat was a nice pairing because it's renowned for its weight variety. The structure of it was similar as well.</p>
            <h4 style="color: #211F20; padding-bottom: 5rem;">Ultimately, I chose Quicksand as the typeface because the characteristics I defined earlier were strongly expressed. While both were good contenders,<span style="color: #CC2936"> Quicksand and Montserrat did the job the best.</span></h4>
          </section>
          <section class="inner brandingColor">
            <h4>Branding: Color</h4>
            <p>Yellow was chosen as the main color for the brand. Yellow carried themes of productivity that were important to communicate. A product focused on project collaboration needs to convey efficiency and movement. Yellow was the perfect color for this.</p>
            <p>The color pallete was changed from what was originally on the mood board. There was a concern for accesibility on some of the combinations. A more matte blue was chosen, along with a an orange and green that would be easier on the eyes.</p>
            <div class="palletes">
              <div class="pallete">

            <h4>Branding: Guidelines</h4>
            <p>Guidelines were created to make sure the brand remains consistent across the board. The guide covered topics ranging from logo use to typography practices. It also includes button styles and acceptable color combinations.</p>

            <h4 style="padding: 5rem 0; color: #211F20;">With the brand guidelines in place, I created the first round of <span style="color: #235789">hi-fidelity mock-ups.</span></h4>
          </section>
          <section class="inner mockUps">
            <h4>Mock Ups</h4>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/mockup/lofi_dash.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Low Fidelity Dashboard">
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/mockup/hifi_dash.png" style="padding-bottom: 0rem" alt="High Fidelity Dashboard">
            <p>On the dashboard, I decreased the size of the add button. Instead of relying on size to make it stand out, I used color. The format of the project list was also changed to be more consistent with the items. This helps maintain consistency as well as provide more information in one area for the user.</p>
            <h4>Mock Ups: Dashboard</h4>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/mockup/lofi_add.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Low Fidelity Add Menu">
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/mockup/hifi_add.png" style="padding-bottom: 0rem" alt="High Fidelity Add Menu">
            <p>I removed the ability to add a file or link from the dashboard. It was never utilized within user testing when asking users to upload items. Instead, there is a single “add” button that displays the “add project pop” up when clicked.</p>
            <h4>Mock Ups: Project Page</h4>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/mockup/lofi_project.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Low Fidelity Project Page">

            <p>While the button changes were made, I also made minor layout changes to help with information organization. I replaced the view of the file/link with an emblem to help boost uniformity. This helped make it easier to scan and boosted efficiency.</p>
            <h4>Mock Ups: Explore Page</h4>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/mockup/lofi_explore.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Low Fidelity Explore Page">

            <p style="color: #211F20">I found that users liked having the option of two different buttons to click a single time. One button that revealed a pop-up menu with a sub button to click wasn't simple. This also lined up with the value of efficiency decided at the beginning of the process.</p>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/preference/win_explore.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Winning Design">
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/preference/lose_explore.png" style="padding-bottom: 0rem" alt="Losing Design">
            <p style="color: #211F20">One surprising consensus was keeping the side element on the page. While I thought it busied the page, users voted to keep it. I did drastically change the size later in the process.</p>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/preference/lose_button.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Losing Design">
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/preference/win_button.png" style="padding-bottom: 0rem" alt="Winning Design">
            <p style="color: #211F20">The final reinforced decision was to keep the submit button to centered and large. Instead of smaller and off to the right corner, again, making actions as simple as possible.</p>

            <h5>Finishing Touches</h5>
            <p>With designs in place, there were some more adjustments to make before delivery.</p>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/finishing/profile1.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Final Profile View">
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/finishing/profile2.png" style="padding-bottom: 0rem" alt="Final Profile View Continued">
            <p>A function to edit your profile was missing and requested in tests. The plan was to leave it out of the MVP. After returning to the idea of the social nature I decided that it was necessary to include. I added a slimmed version of profile editing that could develop more later down the road.</p>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/finishing/navigation1.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Old Navigation Bar">
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/finishing/navigation2.png" style="padding-bottom: 0rem" alt="Final Navigation Bar">
            <p>The next major edit being the navigation bar. I changed the logo to be a user icon as an entry point for users to make adjustments to their profile.The next big change was switching the name of the dashboard to "projects". I did this to help clear confusion between the dashboard and the specific projects page. The final change was changing the page indicators to be nicer to look at. The change also helped to clarify where you are within the application.</p>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/finishing/project1.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Old Project Page">
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/finishing/project2.png" style="padding-bottom: 0rem" alt="Final Project Page">
            <p>The project page received a realignment and organizing of the project information. This allowed the user to read and digest it easier. The two separate buttons that came from preference testing appeared as well.</p>
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/finishing/explore1.png" style="padding-bottom: 2.5rem" alt="Old Explore Page">
            <img src="../images/caseStudyImage/assemble/finishing/explore2.png" style="padding-bottom: 0rem" alt="Final Explore Page">
            <p>The explore page received changes in the item cards once again. I carried these changes to every page to remain consistent. I decreased the rounded corners to help with the alignment of icons and emblems. I didn't make any other major changes outside of that. The page performed well in every test and proved to be effective and efficient.</p>

            <p style="color: #211F20">This project came with a lot of lessons, both technical and theoretical. The main theme I found myself coming back to was the importance of laying a solid foundation to work on. Making decisions and sticking to them makes for smoother work down the road.  The secondary theme for me in this project was the value of user testing. Many times throughout the process, I would make a decision based on trendy design. Each time I did this, users didn't respond well to the design. It was a solid reminder on the importance of being a user-focused designer. It would be a shame to make beautiful designs that no one liked to use.</p>
