Since then we’ve seen major growth in ways that people can make money by utilizing their vehicles. While there are plenty of driver assistance apps out there, all of them are geared towards rideshare drivers. Kurry is a mobile application that that serves as a navigation and tracking tool for drivers who deliver things as opposed to people.</p>

            <h3 class="black pS">The Problem</h3>
            <p>While studying UX I delivered groceries on the side. In my time driving I realized there was a serious hole in driver assistance apps for people who don’t transport people. Seeing this hole inspired me to put my newly acquired skills to work and create an application that could serve drivers who carried things to people rather than people to destinations.</p>
            <h3 class="black pS solution">The Solution</h3>
            <p>Kurry is a driver assistance application that meets the needs of Courier and delivery drivers.Ultimately, Kurry helps drivers maximize their earning potential. With navigation inside of the app, drivers are able to track mileage automatically without having to be tracked through location services 24/7. The summary at the end of each trip allows them to put in their earnings and any tips made, alongside any notes so that they can better track which destinations come with different types of problems or advantages. These features allow drivers to see what they’re really making while keeping their business organized to maximize their earnings.</p>

Being able to take notes, as well as track mileage and earnings would make Kurry stand out.</p>

          <h3>Branding</h3>
          <div class="container1 branding">
            <p class="white">Kurry was named through a mind mapping exercise. While thinking about words that came to mind when thinking of delivery and courier drivers, curry came to mind. It worked well because curry is a food often delivered, and it was a nice play on words with courier. I ultimately decided to spell it with a “K” to help avoid confusion as to what the application does.</p>
            <p class="white">With the name picked, I assigned three characteristics to communicate through branding:</p>
            <ul class="characteristics centered">
              <li class="trait">
                <h3>Warm</h3>
              </li>
              <li class="trait">
                <h3>Energetic</h3>
              </li>
              <li class="trait">
                <h3>Modern</h3>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="white end">Warm because heat is a bi-product of friction which is a result of movement. Energetic because of the fast-paced nature of delivery driving. Modern because it's a platform for a modern gig. With the name and personality in place I moved to creating a logo.</p>

            <p class="white"> After a lot of sketches I chose a “k” logo as it was the most concise. After working through a lot of variations of it, I landed on this logo because of its simplicity, effectiveness, and usability.</p>

            <p class="white">To accompany the logo I chose the typeface “Novel Display” to use as the main type. I chose it because of it’s curved structure that accompanied the logo well. The secondary type I chose “Brandon Grotesque” This type accompanied “Novel Display” well due to its similarities in structure and variable weights.</p>

            <p class="white">The first round of prototypes came with not too much change. Basically the wireframes with the branding color. I utilized a gradient to help bring the application to life. However...it was way too much gradient.</p>

          <div class="container1">
            <p class="white">Due to accessibility concerns (as well as a sheer overwhelming) with the gradient, I chose to stick with a white background and utilize the color to direct the user to important information or elements.This change helped eliminate the need for different color cards to put text on, as well as helped clean up the whole aesthetic of the application. With this change it was much easier to digest the information. </p>

            <p class="white">The only other major change that came about was adding edit and delete buttons on the summary pages. While the original intent was to keep it simple with fields. It was never completed successfully on the paper tests so it seemed the buttons were the best way to go. </p>

            <div class="container1">
              <p class="white">There were a few different approaches to this that I tried. The biggest two I contemplated were either keeping three tabs and having the icon change while on that page (For example if you were on the mileage page, the miles icon would change to a back arrow to bring you directly to the dashboard), or just adding a fourth tab and remove the name “dashboard” and just call it navigation. I ended up choosing to add the fourth tab and name it navigation because it seemed the least complicated, and switching an icon on a user felt like grounds for unnecessary confusion.</p>

          <h3>Quick Access Edit and Delete Buttons</h3>
          <div class="container1">
            <p class="white">The final change was adding quick access to edit and delete buttons on the detail cards. It didn’t come up in testing but thinking through making this as accessible as possible for a driver on the go inspired the addition.</p>

            <p>If I had to choose a recurring theme for this project, it would be that research is key. It started with the features of the project. While I thought the desired features would be about coordinating multiple trips, it turned out to be as simple as leaving notes on customers. Then the theme kept popping up whether it be with color use, button locations, or how features work. While it’s easy to just run with your original ideas, there’s so much more value in getting as much user testing in as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If I had more time on this project, I think I would spend more time redesigning how information is stored and organized. Maybe just have a general trips section with cards that contained both mileage and earnings. Then a finance section that has information for costs and gross income. I would also do some more logo work as I wasn’t totally sold on the final one, however for sake of time needed to turn it in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All in all it was fun to create a product that would help with my actual life. To see it come to life from idea to prototype was a gratifying experience.</p>
